    <h1>Food-Habits-Tendencies</h1>
    <p>​Modern city-dweller is used to consider his food
        for granted, almost like the air we breathe. We all
        understand that nutrition is a vital need, everybody feels
        hunger sometimes, but struggling for food usually changed
        to the choice of it in a menu, fridge or grocery shelves. But
        things​ ​ were​ ​ not​ ​ so​ ​ smooth​ ​ always.
        Control over the food sources always was a factor of
        prosperity because of constantly high demand but limited
        amount. Food was associated with power, prosperity and,
        unfortunately, sometimes weapon. Farming was the main
        occupation for a vast majority of mankind.
        Despite it’s vital meaning food production barely got any
        development at all. From ancient times after very invention
        of irrigation, the plow, and other basic facilities, progress
        seemed to stuck. As food exchange was concerned with
        problems of preserving freshness and large costs, nutrition​ ​
        of​ ​ civilization​ ​ consisted​ ​ mostly​ ​ of​ ​ locally-produced​ ​ food​ ​
        and​ ​ traditional​ ​ meals.
        Therefore ​different nature conditions formed different food
        habits, determining the shape of peoples cultures themselves​.
        Neighbouring nomadic livestock tribes and settled
        agricultural​ ​ workers​ ​ shared​ ​ less​ ​ similarity​ ​ than​ ​ their​ ​
        “colleagues”​ ​ from​ ​ other​ ​ parts​ ​ of​ ​ the​ ​ world.
        Exploration and analysis of world food habits may help in
        better understanding of food security and be useful in
        finding new ways of solving this problems.</p>
    <h2>Data</h2>
    <p>Main dataset used in this project was taken from <a href="http://www.oecd.org">OECD website</a> Part of the data we used can be found <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ox8dVyJQVZN9lEoe4prMy0xvh1U6AfIk/view">here</a>.</p>
    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>Approach
        Analysing nutritional habits requires unsupervised approach, so we used machine learning method - clustering.
        Namely, k-means and DBSCAN algorithms. We also applied PCA and t-SNE dimensionality reduction to visualize high-dimensional data.
